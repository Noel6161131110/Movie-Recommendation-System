First, we would read the "movies.csv" file using pandas dataframe.Then, we have to clean the Movie Titles using the regex library and then we have to make a (Term-Frequency * Inverse-Document-Frequency) matrix.
Then we are making a search function using cosine_similarity in the sklearn library and then we are making a interactive widget in Jupyter Notebook.Thus we have made a search algorithm for searching through movies.
